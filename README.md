# Enrique Juan de Dios
Hi, I'm JD a Senior Full Stack Developer. I live in Buenos Aires, Argentina. 🙌 I'm a huge nerd/geek, Starcraft Broodwar player, and aspiring writer.

## How to solve issues
1. Analyze the problem
2. Break the one big problem into smaller sub-problems
3. Solve them one by one
4. Always search for a better solution.
5. Enjoy!
